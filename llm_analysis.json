        "text": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is probing a possible insider trading among senior officials of IndusInd Bank amid significant accounting lapses by the lender, the Economic Times reported on March 27. The shares of the bank slipped 0.9 percent to Rs 649.4 on NSE at 09:57 am on Thursday. The Mumbai-based lender reported earlier this month that it had discovered accounting discrepancies in the way it booked currency derivatives, going back at least six years, with an estimated impact of about $175 million. The market regulator has sought information about trades executed by five senior officials while they were in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information of IndusInd, the newspaper said, citing two people close to the development. SEBI is also examining whether IndusInd violated its disclosure norms, the report said. The lender did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. It has appointed an independent firm to conduct an investigation into the lapses and the discrepancies, which have also led to concerns over governance at the bank. Reuters reported earlier this week that IndusInd had appointed Grant Thornton to conduct the review. Shares of IndusInd have fallen over 27% since it first announced the lapses on March 10. ",

        "text": "A\u00a0two-judge bench of Delhi High Court on Wednesday refrained Natco Pharma from launching the generic version of Swiss drugmaker Roche Pharma's patented drug Risdiplam until the hearing on April 2. Risdiplam used in treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare-genetic disease, that causes muscle weakness and atrophy, due to damage to nerve cells in the spinal cord, leading to difficulty with basic functions like walking, breathing, and swallowing. A single judge of Delhi High Court had earlier denied an injunction request from Roche on March 24, in an alleged patent infringement case against Natco Pharma, potentially opening the door for access to a generic of the patented drug Risdiplam at a fraction of the marketed cost. An injunction is an order issued by a court, to a party, requiring them to either perform or abstain from a specific act. Roche has filed an appeal against the Delhi High Court order that allows Natco Pharma to go ahead with the launch of the copycat version, at a fraction of the cost. Roche Pharma India has confirmed the stay on the Natco Pharma's launch. \"Roche has filed an appeal against the Hon. Delhi High Court order and the matter is subjudice in the appeal court,\" Roche Pharma India spokesperson told Moneycontrol. \u201cRoche is committed to protecting its innovation,\" the spokesperson added. Roche Pharma said since the launch of Evrysdi (risdiplam) - the first and still the only approved solution for SMA in 2021 , the company has been actively collaborating with local authorities in India to implement tailored pricing. Roche had moved the court seeking interim injunction for restraining the infringement of the Suit Patent No. IN 334397, arguing that it has a term of 20 years from May 2015 till May 2035. It said there has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition, or any revocation proceedings filed against the suit patent in India. \"We are also supporting patients through our patient assistance program which makes Evrysdi more affordable. Our commitment to patients in India began well before it was commercially available. In 2020, Roche initiated a Compassionate Use Program (CUP) for SMA patients under which 52 patients across India are benefitting free of cost. Today we have over 270 SMA patients in India who have benefitted from Evrysdi since its launch in India,\" the company said. Natco spokesperson couldn't be reached for the comment. Seba PA and Purva Mittal, two young women battling SMA, had intervened in the case to highlight the urgent need for the court to consider their right to life in the matter, as well as the significant negative impact an injunction could have on access to the drug Risdiplam, given the price disparity between patented drug and its anticipated, low-cost generic. ",
        "analysis": "**1. Key Topics:**\n\n* **Patent Dispute:** Roche Pharma is suing Natco Pharma for alleged patent infringement of its drug Risdiplam.\n* **Access to Medicine:** The case highlights the tension between protecting intellectual property and ensuring affordable access to life-saving drugs, particularly for rare diseases like Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).\n* **Court Proceedings:** The Delhi High Court initially denied Roche's injunction request, but a two-judge bench has now issued a stay until a further hearing.\n* **Drug Pricing:**  Roche emphasizes its patient assistance programs and tailored pricing strategies, while Natco's generic version is expected to be significantly cheaper.\n* **Patient Advocacy:**  Two SMA patients have intervened in the case, arguing for access to affordable treatment.\n\n\n**2. Sentiment Analysis:**\n\nThe overall sentiment is **neutral**, leaning slightly towards **negative** due to the ongoing legal battle and uncertainty surrounding access to the drug.  While Roche expresses commitment to patients, the lawsuit itself creates a negative connotation. The patient intervention adds a layer of urgency and concern.\n\n\n**3. Summary:**\n\nRoche Pharma and Natco Pharma are locked in a patent dispute over the drug Risdiplam, used to treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). After an initial court ruling allowed Natco to launch a generic version, Roche successfully appealed, resulting in a temporary stay on the launch.  This legal battle highlights the conflict between patent protection and affordable drug access.  Two SMA patients have joined the case, emphasizing the critical need for affordable treatment options.  Roche claims to offer patient assistance programs, but the generic version is anticipated to be significantly less expensive.  The final outcome of the case will have major implications for access to Risdiplam in India.\n"
